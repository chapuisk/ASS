Abstract = {{Cooperation is generally the most advantageous strategy for the group;
   however, on an individual level, cheating is frequently more attractive.
   In a fishery, one can choose to cooperate by fishing only the regulated
   amount or not to cooperate, by fishing to maximize profits. Top-down
   management can help to emulate a cooperative result in fisheries, but it
   is costly and not always a viable alternative for development states.
   Here, we investigate elements of a fishing system that can be
   strategically managed to encourage a cooperative behaviour. Using
   bioeconomic data, we modelled an evolutionary game between two
   populations of fishers that differ if they cooperate or do not cooperate
   with a fishing restriction. We penalized players including risk
   tolerance and control perception, two social parameters that might
   favour cooperation. We assessed the degrees to which risk tolerance and
   control perception affect the cooperative behaviours of fishers in a
   restricted fishing effort small-scale fishery (RSSF) in southern Brazil.
   We also assessed the likelihood of a scenario wherein a cooperative
   strategy can evolve and dominate the system. We identified dominance and
   coexistence outcomes for the RSSF. Sensitivity analyses suggested that
   both control perception and risk tolerance could facilitate a
   cooperative outcome for the fishery.}},

Abstract = {{Canadian First Nations communities rely on traditional preservation
   methods such as the smoking, drying, and canning of fish and game meats
   to ensure long-term food security. Unlike commercial food production,
   there are no recognized official standards for these methods, rendering
   their efficacy in producing microbiologically safe foods relatively
   unknown. In this study, 81 fresh or processed fish and game samples
   obtained from four British Columbia First Nations communities were
   analyzed for quality indicator microbes, foodborne pathogens, and
   mineral levels. Aerobic counts, coliforms (CC), Escherichia coli (EC),
   lactic acid bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (STA), and yeast and molds
   (YM) were enumerated using the TEMPO, whereas the presence of E. coli
   O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella were detected using the
   VIDAS immunoassay system. The opportunistic pathogens Enterococcus
   faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were additionally detected using
   culture methods with subsequent PCR confirmation, and minerals (Ca, Cu,
   K, Mg, Mn, Na, and Zn) were detected using mass spectrometry. With the
   exception of STA, microbial loads were significantly (P, 0.05) higher in
   processed fish and meat samples compared with unprocessed samples, and
   game samples contained higher microbial levels than fish; however,
   differences were only significant (P, 0.05) for coliforms, E. coli, and
   STA. E. coli O157:H7 was detected in one smoked moose sample, and E.
   faecalis and E. faecium were isolated from 21 and 2 samples,
   respectively. Although smoked samples contained significantly higher Na
   levels, they were effective in reducing microbial levels. These results
   indicate that current food preservation methods practiced by British
   Columbia First Nations communities are infrequently effective at
   reducing microbial populations, and in many cases, resulted in increased
   microbial loads. More efforts should be made to improve the
   dissemination of safe food handling and processing knowledge to ensure
   long-term food security and well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Complex dynamic systems such as common-pool resource systems can undergo
   a critical shift at a given threshold, the so-called tipping point,
   which potentially requires substantial changes from the management
   system. We present in this research a framed laboratory experiment
   design to examine how the threat of economic sanctions influences the
   strategic management of a common-pool resource. We use the context of
   the East Atlantic bluefin tuna international fishery as it has been the
   archetype of an overfished and mismanaged fishery until a dramatic
   reinforcement of its regulations followed the threat of a trade ban. We
   consider endogenous threats and examine their effects on cooperation
   through harvest decisions taken in the context of non-cooperative game
   theory in which cooperation could be sustained using a trigger strategy.
   Our experiment results show that the threat of economic sanctions
   fosters more cooperative behaviors, less over-exploitation, and a more
   precautionary management of resources, reducing the economic rent
   dissipation. This result is exacerbated when the location of the tipping
   point that triggers the economic sanction is uncertain. In order to
   avoid free-riding behaviors and foster the emergence of a self-enforcing
   agreement, we suggest to introduce economic sanctions, such as trade
   restrictions, associated with uncertain biological limit reference
   points.}},

Abstract = {{Antibiotic use in animal production, including aquaculture, has become a

   possible temporal trends in antibiotic susceptibility of several

   susceptibility was variable among hatcheries and among pathogens.
   Predicted susceptibility was generally unchanged or increased on average

Abstract = {{The rivers in the western Great Plains of the United States are
   characterized by low gradients, sandy substrates, and a relative
   scarcity of structural habitat. Habitat improvement projects in these
   systems often involve the addition of large wood and rock riprap to
   increase habitat for nonnative game fishes, such as piscivorous Brown
   Trout Salmo trutta. However, little is known about the use of added
   habitats by the small-bodied nongame fishes that historically dominated
   the fish assemblages in these systems. We evaluated habitat availability
   and fish habitat use in the Laramie River (Wyoming, USA) at four sites
   that contained natural and added habitats. We calculated habitat
   selection for three natural cover types (natural wood, macrophytes, and
   undercut bank), two added cover types (added wood and rock riprap), and
   open water. Open-water habitat dominated all sites (87-94\% of the
   stream area), but all species except Johnny Darter Etheostoma nigrum
   showed negative selection for this cover type. Most species showed
   positive selection for both natural and added cover types but showed
   greater selectivity for natural wood compared to added wood. Native,
   small-bodied fishes in the Laramie River used added cover types intended
   to benefit populations of Brown Trout. Thus, features that enhance
   habitat for Brown Trout also should benefit native species in Great
   Plains rivers that have limited natural structural habitat.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{9-19}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Animals tend to learn and make decisions inductively, and simple,
   individual-level behavioural decisions can scale up to yield interesting
   emergent properties at the population level. The minority game is a
   theoretical formulation based on the principle of inductive learning,
   wherein a group of individuals, each facing two equivalent choices,
   self-organize to achieve maximum coordination. Coordination increases
   with memory length up to a certain threshold, and thereafter, at very
   high memory lengths, decisions resemble a random choice game. We invoked
   and observed minority games in guppies, Poecilia reticulata, by forcing
   them to choose between two symmetric chambers in a series of repeated
   trials. At an intermediate timescale, guppies self-organized into a
   globally efficient state featuring maximum coordination. After a large
   number of trials, the guppies approached a steady state in which they
   behaved as if they were randomly choosing between the two chambers.
   Intriguingly, both the time taken to reach this globally efficient state
   (i.e. learning time) and the grouping behaviour for decision making
   depended on the sexual composition of the fish populations. We
   identified a positive correlation between group size and learning time
   in the experiments, which we further explored using simulations to
   uncover the form of decision-making framework at play, testing between a
   leader-based framework and a consensus-based one. Our simulations
   supported the presence of a consensus-based decision-making process in
   the system. This work also provides an unexplored general framework to
   further investigate and understand simple decision-making dynamics and
   structure in animal groups. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{465}},
Pages = {{17-26}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Evolutionary game dynamics in finite populations can be described by a
   frequency-dependent, stochastic Wright-Fisher process. The fitness of
   individuals in a population is not only linked to environmental
   conditions but also tightly coupled to the types and frequencies of
   competitors, leading to different types of individuals with different
   selection intensities. We studied a 2 x 2 symmetric game in a finite
   population and established a dynamic model of the Wright-Fisher process
   by introducing different selection intensities for different strategies.
   Thus, we provided another effective way to study the evolutionary
   dynamics of a finite population and obtained the analytical expressions
   of fixation probabilities under weak selection. The fixation probability
   of a strategy is not only related to a game matrix but also to different
   selection intensities. The conditions required for natural selection to
   favor one strategy and for that strategy to be an evolutionary stable
   strategy (ESSN) are specified in our model. We compared our results with
   those of a Moran dynamic process with different selection intensities to
   explore these two processes better. In the two processes, the conditions
   conducive to the strategy's taking fixation are the same. By simulation
   analysis, the dynamic relationships between the fixation probabilities
   and selection intensities were intuitively observed in the prisoner's
   dilemma, coordination, and coexistence games. The fixation probability
   of the cooperative strategy in the prisoner's dilemma decreases with the
   increase of its own selection intensity. In the coexistence and
   coordination games, the fixation probability of the cooperative strategy
   increases with its own selection intensity. For the three types of
   games, the fixation probability of the cooperative strategy decreases
   with the increase of the selection intensity of the defection strategy.

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Trawlers that target Nephrops norvegicus and a range of demersal fish
   species need gear options to reduce bycatch and address European Union
   landing obligation requirements. We demonstrated how this can be
   achieved by using inclined panels to separate fish species into an upper
   codend with 90 mm T90-mesh, and Nephrops norvegicus into a lower codend
   with 80 mm diamond-mesh. A nested mixed effects model was developed to
   compare proportional catch at length of key species retained in test or
   control trawls, and based on this, the conditional probability of
   retention in the upper and lower test trawl codends. Haddock
   (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) < minimum
   conservation reference size (MCRS) were significantly reduced, while
   haddock >= MCRS, Nephrops, cod (Gadus morhua), monkfish (Lophius
   piscatorius), and commercial flatfish catches were generally maintained
   in the test trawl. Model outputs demonstrated effective separation of
   Nephrops into the lower codend, and size dependent separation of haddock
   and whiting into the upper codend. Strong performance of this catch
   separation device facilitates alternative selectivity measures depending
   on landing obligation requirements. Additional benefits such as improved
   catch quality and reduced catch sorting times, but also the need for
   further incentives to encourage industry uptake are discussed.}},

   it was verified that the utilization of reward mechanisms did not
   represent an efficient alternative for the maintenance of contributions
   to the reservoir. It was also found that both indigenes and fishermen
   presented behaviours different from those described in the literature
   regarding the use of punishment, whether due to decentralization of
   decision-making or fear of retaliation. Although not often used,
   prediction of a punishing mechanism has proved to be efficient in
   maintaining levels of donations to the reservoir at statistically
   similar levels. In order to foster initiatives for joint projects, as
   well as better manage them, we should focus on the particularities

   evolutionary games. In particular, the additional growing dimensions in
   minimal systems that close the dynamics of the game density processes

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The classical game-theoretical models described the conflict in
   fisheries arising from harvesting a `common pool resource' which without
   an efficient regulation leads to an over-exploitation of a renewable but
   not unlimited resource, known as the `tragedy of the commons'. Unlike
   these studies, the present paper deals with a marketing cooperative of
   micro or small enterprises in fishing industry, formed to negotiate a
   contracted price with large buyers, sharing risk among members of the
   cooperative. In the paper a game-theoretical model for the behaviour in
   this cooperative is set up. By the time of the actual commercialization
   of the product, the market price may be higher than what the cooperative
   can guarantee for members, negotiated on beforehand. Therefore some
   ``unfaithful{''} members may be interested in selling at least a part of
   their product on the free market, the cooperative, however, can punish
   them for this. This conflict is modelled with a multi-person normal form
   game. An evolutionary dynamics is proposed for the continuous change of
   the applied strategies, which in the long term leads to a particular
   Nash equilibrium, considered the solution of the game. This strategy
   dynamics is continuously influenced by an ``exosystem{''} describing the
   dynamics of fishing, based on a classical fishing effort model. This
   approach focuses only on the conflict within the marketing cooperative,
   since it is supposed that the single enterprises fish from independent
   resources. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Game theory studies the strategic interactions between and among
   decision makers, players, through mathematical models called games. This
   paper presents an overview on the evolution of the application of game
   theory to fisheries economics. The first applications emerged in the
   late 1970s, focussing upon internationally shared fish stocks. This
   occurred in the context of the UN Third Conference on the Law of the
   Sea, and the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. During the 1980s
   and early 1990s the application of game theory to fisheries focused
   mainly on transboundary fish stocks. Thereafter, the applications to
   straddling fish stocks developed significantly, through the use of
   coalition games. This was a consequence of the mismanagement of these
   stocks, and the management regime brought forth in response by the 1995
   UN Fish Stocks Agreement. The application of game theory to the
   management of national/regional fisheries is a new research frontier, as
   it is still much underexplored, when compared to international
   fisheries. This paper also summarizes the main research developments of
   a set of nine papers selected for this special issue on Game Theory and
   Fisheries.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{203}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{63-73}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This note analyzes in a fishery management problem the effects of
   relaxing one of the usual assumptions in the literature of dynamic
   games. Specifically, the assumption that players restrict to strategies
   that stabilize the system. Previous works in the literature have shown
   that feedback Nash equilibria can exist in which a player can improve
   unilaterally by choosing a feedback control for which the closed-loop
   system is unstable. This paper considers in some more detail the
   implication this setting has in the framework of a simple fishery
   management. It is shown that if the fishermen are not short-sighted in
   their valuation of future profits, the considered approach implies a
   division of them into two groups. One group going for maximal profits
   and the other group taking care of the imposed stability constraint.
   To see how noise might impact these results we additionally consider a
   framework where fishermen take into account the possibility that the
   fish growth might be corrupted by external factors. We consider a
   deterministic approach of dealing with noise in this set-up.
   The model predicts that the more people are involved in the group taking
   care of the stabilization constraint, the less active they get.
   Furthermore it predicts that the natural reaction of any of these
   persons is to increase his activities if he expects more noise. But that
   this activity is reduced, and partly replaced by more active control
   policies by group members, if the size of the group increases. Activity
   of fishermen going for maximal profits is not affected by noise
   expectations.}},

Abstract = {{Growing to lengths and weights exceeding 1.5 m and 45 kg, the
   hump-backed mahseer fish of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot,
   India, is an iconic, mega-faunal species that is globally recognized as
   a premier freshwater game fish. Despite reports of their high extinction
   risk, conservation approaches are currently constrained by their lack of
   valid taxonomic identity. Using an integrative approach, incorporating
   morphology, molecular analysis and historical photographs, this fish can
   now be revealed to be conspecific with Tor remadevii, a species lacking
   a common name, that was initially, but poorly, described in 2007 from
   the River Pambar, a tributary of the River Cauvery in Kerala. Currently
   known to be endemic and restricted to the River Cauvery basin in the
   Western Ghats, T. remadevii is distinguished from congeners by its
   prominent hump originating above the pre-opercle and extending to the
   origin of the dorsal fin, a well-developed mandible resulting in a
   terminal or slightly superior mouth position, and the dorsal orientation
   of the eyes. While body colouration varies (silver, bronze, greenish)
   and is not considered a reliable diagnostic character, orange coloration
   of the caudal fin (sometimes extending to all fins) is considered a
   consistent characteristic. Having been first brought to the attention of
   the scientific community in 1849, and the recreational angling (game
   fishing) community in 1873, it has taken over 150 years to finally
   provide this iconic fish with a valid scientific name. This taxonomic
   clarity should now assist development and delivery of urgent
   conservation actions commensurate with their extinction risk.}},

Abstract = {{A simple game-theoretic model for upstream fish migration, which is a
   key element in life history of diadromous fishes, is proposed.
   Foundation of the model is a minimization problem on the cost of
   migration with the swimming speed and school size as the variables to be
   simultaneously optimized. Finding the optimizer ultimately reduces to
   solving a self-consistency equation without explicit solutions.
   Mathematical analytical results lead to the sufficient condition that
   the self-consistency equation has a unique solution, which turns out to
   be identified with the condition where the unique optimizer exists.
   Behavior of the optimizer is analyzed both mathematically and
   numerically to show its biophysical and ecological consequences. The
   analytical results demonstrate reasonable agreement between the present
   mathematical model and the theoretical and experimental results of
   upstream migration of fish schools reported in the past research.}},

Abstract = {{Using a game theory framework, this paper models the behavior of two
   stakeholder groups who are concerned with the implementation and
   enforcement of a marine park at Balaclava, situated in the North-West of
   the island of Mauritius, located in the Indian Ocean. These two
   stakeholders are artisanal fishers and hotel-based pleasure
   craft/water-sports operators who often have-to compete-spatially within
   the lagoon to carry out their activity. Nash equilibrium results show
   that fishers and pleasure craft operators may reach a sub-optimal
   outcome, leading to unsustainability of marine resources. Empirical
   verification of strategic motives, attitudes and perceptions, using a
   questionnaire-based survey, actually revealed that there is little
   convincing evidence that both parties would be able to collaborate and
   co manage the park successfully despite the fact that they agree that a
   marine park is vital for protecting marine resources. While 81.3 per
   cent of the fishers and 90.1 per cent of the hotel water-based sports
   operators were in favor of a marine park, only 28 per cent of the hotel
   sports operators would be willing to work in collaboration with fishers
   and 46 per cent of the fishers would be willing to work with their
   counterparts. One of the major policy recommendations that emanates from
   this study is that the authorities should come up with an effective
   action plan to foster more dialogues among all concerned stakeholders
   and emphasize the virtues of co-management for the sustainability of the
   park. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{16-28}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Fermentation of dairy products, legumes, fish, shellfish, molluscs, and
   meat are considered to lead to some of the most flavourful products in
   cuisines across the world. The deliciousness of these fermented products
   is to a large extent due to compounds like free amino acids and free
   nucleotides, formed during fermentation, which impart umami taste, often
   in a synergistic fashion. We have prepared fermented fish sauces based
   on mackerel, using procedures as in the ancient Roman cuisine, and used
   similar techniques to produce experimental fermented sauces from insects
   (moths and grasshoppers), game (pheasant), and pulses (peas). In some
   cases, the fermentation has been facilitated by fungal inoculation based
   on a Japanese koji mother. We have performed chemical analysis of these
   experimental fermentation products, together with a comparative analysis
   of a series of commercial fish sauces, with particular focus on free
   amino acids and free nucleotides in order to assess the umami potential
   of the various products. Whereas all of the 21 different investigated
   sauces are found to have high amounts of glutamate and aspartate, no
   significant amounts of free nucleotides are found in any of the samples.
   The investigated sauces were characterized by quantitative sensory
   evaluation. Although high in glutamate, umami synergy is not expected to
   play any significant role for the flavour of these fish, insect, game,
   and pea sauces. The sensory analysis shows a fairly good prediction of
   sensory properties from the chemical characterization of the sauces.
   However, the relationship between glutamate/aspartate concentration and
   intensity of umami taste is not simple. It demonstrates that in the
   complex solutions that constitute these sauces, there may be other
   perceptions that interfere with the main umami-tasting compounds.}},

   been widely studied, comparatively little is known about its proximate

   responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens in the brains
   and gonads of teleosts, respectively, on the different stages of the
   maternal care period of the biparental cichlid Cichlasoma dimerus,

   neural distribution of brain aromatase and observed it exclusively
   within the forebrain, including areas involved in the regulation of
   parental behavior. We next analyzed the gene expression of brain
   aromatase in the brain, and gonadal aromatase in the ovary, of female
   chanchitas through the parental care period. To further characterize the
   physiological environment associated to maternal care, we also evaluated
   sex steroid levels (17 beta-estradiol, testosterone and
   11-ketotestoterone) and ovarian follicle percentage. The onset of
   parental behavior specifically downregulated sex steroids synthesis and
   the rate of ovarian maturation, as denoted by a more than 10-fold
   decrease in steroid levels and delayed detection of mature follicles in
   females with offspring, compared to females which eggs were removed.
   Gene expression levels of both aromatases were independent of maternal

Abstract = {{Understanding how to effectively and efficiently reduce fishing effort
   is a marine conservation imperative, given falling catches, degrading
   coastal systems and burgeoning human populations. Globally, studies into
   understanding who may leave a fishery, and why, have tended to be survey
   based, offering important but limited insights into exit behavior. At
   the same time attempts to introduce alternative livelihoods to fishing
   communities in developing countries often fail, and fishers are hostile
   to efforts to implement regulatory restrictions on their fishing
   activities. This paper argues exploring shifting behaviors through
   quasi-experimental field games offers inroads to this dilemma. Firstly,
   such games can triangulate with both observational and survey-based data
   to deepen understanding of how and why fishers may exit the fishery.
   Secondly, face-to-face interaction and stakeholder participation are
   important for improving natural resource management, and are facilitated
   by games. I illustrate these points using the example of ReefGame,
   played in multi-stakeholder workshops with small-scale fishers across
   the Philippines. Characterizing players as `shifters', `intermittent
   shifters' and `non-shifters' highlights how non-economic considerations,
   meso-economic contexts and desires for the next generation to have `a
   better life' can inform more responsive and effective fisheries
   management. At the same time, the game offers structured opportunities
   for scientists, managers and fishers to interact, building trust and
   understanding between them. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   categorization was faster and more accurate when the rate at which a
   fish oscillated in size matched the rate at which the accompanying,
   task-irrelevant sound was amplitude modulated. Control conditions showed
   that the difference between responses to matched and mismatched
   audiovisual signals reflected a performance gain in the matched
   condition, rather than a cost from the mismatched condition. The
   performance advantage with matched audiovisual signals was remarkably
   robust over changes in task demands between experiments. Performance
   with matched or unmatched audiovisual signals improved over successive
   trials at about the same rate, emblematic of perceptual learning in
   which visual oscillation rate becomes more discriminable with
   experience. Finally, analysis at the level of individual subjects'
   performance pointed to differences in the rates at which subjects can
   extract information from audiovisual stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a particular pursuit-evasion game, called as
   ``fishing game{''} where a faster evader attempts to pass the gap
   between two pursuers. We are concerned with the conditions under which
   the evader or pursuers can win the game. This is a game of kind in which
   an essential aspect, barrier, separates the state space into disjoint
   parts associated with each player's winning region. We present a method
   of explicit policy to construct the barrier. This method divides the
   fishing game into two subgames related to the included angle and the
   relative distances between the evader and the pursuers, respectively,
   and then analyzes the possibility of capture or escape for each subgame
   to ascertain the analytical forms of the barrier. Furthermore, we fuse
   the games of kind and degree by solving the optimal control strategies
   in the minimum time for each player when the initial state lies in their
   winning regions. Along with the optimal strategies, the trajectories of
   the players are delineated and the upper bounds of their winning times
   are also derived.}},

Abstract = {{Knowing which site attributes have relevance for anglers is valuable
   information for fishery managers seeking to improve angler satisfaction
   and manage fish stocks. Recreation demand models typically have limited
   information about site attributes and in many instances is limited to
   just a few measures for each site. We assemble a recreational angling
   dataset with extensive information on site attributes and model angling
   demand to ascertain the importance of attributes in decisions on trip
   duration. However, we find that only a small number of site attributes
   are important determinants of trip duration, including attributes such
   as ease of physical access, availability of guiding services, specimen
   fish, and `catch \& release' status. We also find that importance of
   site attributes differs by target species. The key site attributes
   influencing trip duration of anglers targeting coarse species (i.e.
   non-salmonid) are good physical access or availability of specimen fish,
   with trip duration to such sites one day longer, on average. Key site
   attributes for anglers targeting salmonid game species are the
   availability of guiding services and whether the fishery is regulated as
   `catch \& release'. On average, anglers' trip duration is a half day
   less in `catch \& release' fisheries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Sex change has been widely documented in many commercially and
   recreationally important fish species, yet the implications of this life
   history trait are not considered in most stock assessments. This
   omission can lead to poor estimates of parameters vital to understanding
   the health of sequentially hermaphroditic stocks. Here, we present a
   game theoretic approach to model the sex changing behaviour of a stock
   of protogynous (female first) hermaphroditic fish and produce estimates
   of maximum sustainable yield (MSY), equilibrium biomass at MSY (BMSY)
   and sex ratio, then compare these reference points to those from an
   otherwise identical gonochoristic (non-sex changing) stock. We tested
   each stock at varying levels of exploitation and with a range of
   assumptions about how sex ratio impacts fertilization rate. We show that
   a protogynous hermaphroditic stock with flexible timing of sex change
   produces similar MSY and slightly higher BMSY than a gonochoristic stock
   with otherwise identical vital rates. Sex changing stocks were also able
   to maintain a higher proportion of males in the population than did
   non-sex changing stocks as exploitation increased. Although sex changing
   stocks were able to maintain their sex ratio, the age at which females
   changed sex decreased with increased exploitation, suggesting smaller
   body size, and presumably lower fecundity, for females in heavily
   exploited sex changing stocks. Our game theoretic approach to evaluating
   hermaphroditic stocks can accommodate a wide variety of sex changing
   cues and behaviours and allows a flexible model for understanding the
   effects of exploitation on hermaphroditic stocks.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines British newspaper representations of the Team GB'
   athlete Mohamed Mo' Farah during the 2012 London Olympic Games. In
   particular, attention is given to examining how representations of Farah
   were related to discourses on British multiculturalism. A brief
   discussion of recent rejections of multiculturalism is provided, with
   specific reference given to political and public calls for immigrants to
   assimilate with British values'. By turning away from a dichotomous
   understanding of assimilation, this article suggests that processes of
   assimilation reflect a complicated coalescence of national inclusion and
   exclusion. That is, rather than simply highlighting how the national
   press serve to reproduce simple us' and them' binaries, this article
   draws upon Elias and Scotson's established-outsider perspective in order
   to examine how the discursive construction of the nation' rests upon a
   dynamic process of identifying and managing outsider' individuals. As a
   result, while outsider' groups are frequently subjected to negative
   media portrayals, it is argued that Farah's significance was underscored
   by discourses that sought to highlight his assimilated Britishness and
   through his promotion as a symbol of Britain's achieved
   multiculturalism.}},

Abstract = {{River-based cage aquaculture in Northern Thailand involves dealing with
   a number of climate- and weather-related risks. The purpose of this
   study was to improve understanding of how farmers make investment
   decisions in their fish farms when faced with risks from floods that are
   imperfectly known, and which may be changing. A role-playing simulation
   game was created to capture some of the key features of the
   decision-making context and explored with farmers in the field. In-depth
   interviews were conducted post-game to reflect on strategies used in the
   game as compared to in practice. As hypothesized, more frequent or
   larger impact floods reduced cumulative profits. Farmers reduced their
   stocking densities when playing in games with high likelihood of floods,
   but did not do so in games with large impacts when a flood occurred.
   Contrary to initial expectations, farmers were less likely to learn from
   experience-choose the optimal density and thus improve score within a
   game-when floods were common or had large impacts. Farmers learnt most
   when risks were decreasing and least when they were increasing.
   Providing information about likelihoods prior to a game had no impact on
   performance or decisions. The methods and findings of this study
   underline the importance of understanding decision-making behaviour
   around risks for climate risk management. The novel combination of
   experimental, role-playing, and qualitative methods revealed limitations
   in common assumptions about the ease of learning about risks from
   previous experiences. The findings also suggest that decision-support
   systems for aquaculture need to take into account how recent
   experiences, understanding of information, and other factors influence
   risk perceptions and decisions.}},

   pike, the dominance of a flat topography in the watershed explained 31
   \% of the variability in lower Hg concentrations. Higher mean annual
   temperatures explained 27 \% of the variability in higher pike Hg

   taxes or higher subsidies than a situation with one regulating

Abstract = {{Economic Experimental Games have shown that individuals make decisions

   objective of this study is to analyze private inefficient extraction
   behavior in experimental games and to associate the type of player and
   the type of player group with such inefficient outcomes. To do this, we
   carried out economic experimental games with local coastal fishermen in
   Colombia, using a setting where the scarcity of the resource allows for
   an interior Nash equilibrium and inefficient over-extraction is
   possible. The state of the resource, the type of player and the

   to obtain a utility gain. We investigate the extent to which an agent's
   utility can be increased by unilateral strategic plays and prove that
   the percentage of this improvement is at most 2 for markets with weak
   gross substitute utilities. Equivalently, we show that truthfully
   reporting is a 0.5-approximate Nash equilibrium in this game. To
   identify sufficient conditions for truthfully reporting being close to
   Nash equilibrium, we conduct a parameterized study on strategic
   behaviors and further show that the ratio of utility gain decreases
   linearly as buyer's initial endowment increases or his maximum share of
   an item decreases. Finally, we consider collusive behavior of a
   coalition and prove that the utility gain is bounded by 1/(1 - maximum
   share of the collusion). Our findings justify the truthful reporting
   assumption in Fisher markets by a quantitative study on participants
   incentive, and imply that under large market assumption, the utility
   gain of a buyer from manipulations diminishes to 0.}},

Abstract = {{This paper surveys the application of game theory to the economic
   analysis of international fisheries agreements. The relevance of this
   study comes not only from the existence of a vast literature on the
   topic but especially from the specific features of these agreements. The
   emphasis of the survey is on coalition games, an approach that has
   become prominent in the fisheries economics literature over the last
   decade. It is shown that coalition games were first applied to
   international fisheries agreements in the late 1990s addressing
   cooperative issues under the framework of characteristic function games.
   Then, progressively, this cooperative approach was combined with
   non-cooperative elements such as the stability analysis of the
   agreements. Finally, partition function games, which model coalition
   formation endogenously, were introduced and became the standard approach
   to study the formation and stability of international fisheries
   agreements. A key message that emerges from this literature strand is
   that self-enforcing cooperative management of internationally shared
   fish stocks is generally difficult to achieve. Hence, the international
   legal framework and regulations play a decisive role on ensuring
   cooperation over the use of these resources.}},

Volume = {{46}},

Pages = {{763-791}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. Previous research demonstrates three main causes for
   frequent cases of overexploitation of renewable resources: open access,
   provision problem and misperception of dynamics.
   Aim. The aim of this study is to explore the role of a fourth factor for
   overexploitation of renewable resources, managerial myopia (also
   referred to as short-termism), as well as to further explore the role of
   mental models, personal heuristics and group dynamics in mismanagement
   of renewable resources.
   Method. For this purpose, the study adopts an experimental design using
   a System Dynamics (SD)-based Interactive Learning Environment (ILE). The
   SD-ILE offers sufficient information to the players who are instructed
   to operate in an oligopoly situation where open access is excluded.
   Findings. Managerial myopia seems to be a relevant factor in pushing
   players to develop short-term, over-aggressive policies. The simulations
   show that optimal or sufficient policies are rejected by players, even
   when correctly identified, due to perverse incentives generated by
   short-term accounting goals. A feasible solution for myopic behavior is
   identified and tested: measuring a larger, balanced set of performance
   indicators on which managers develop their strategies.
   Conclusions. The experiment shows that significant improvements in
   performance and mitigation of myopic behavior are possible. It also
   demonstrates the relevant role that SD-ILEs may play in studying
   renewable resource issues and assisting decision-makers in developing
   and implementing coherent policies.}},

   fishery}},
Journal = {{FISHERIES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{172}},
Pages = {{7-16}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Simple non-cooperative and cooperative game theory is used to explore
   the crisis involving the European Union (EU), Norway, Iceland and the
   Faroe Islands regarding the size and relative allocation of total
   allowable catches (TACs) in the mackerel fishery in the Northeast
   Atlantic. The analysis of the mackerel crisis is based on a statistical
   estimation of relevant functional relations, and the behavior of the
   players is explained using a fully specified empirical model. Simple,
   non-cooperative game theory shows that all players have an incentive to
   act non-cooperatively, a result that is robust to changes in basic
   assumptions regarding demand and cost functions. Thus, using the
   estimated parameters and functions, simple, non-cooperative game theory
   cannot explain the cooperative behavior of EU and Norway during the
   mackerel crisis. Simple cooperative game theory shows that no player has
   an incentive to enter a bargaining agreement by forming coalitions, a
   prediction that is consistent with the actual behavior of the EU,
   Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands between 2010 and 2014 when no
   bargaining solution was reached. Therefore, the fact that the EU and
   Norway entered a bilateral agreement in 2010 and that the EU, Norway and
   the Faroe Islands reached a bargaining solution in 2014 cannot be
   explained by simple cooperative game theory. However, actual behavior
   during the mackerel crisis can be explained by opportunity costs,
   including alternative fishing possibilities and regulations, rather than
   actual harvest costs, but we do not have information about the
   opportunity costs of harvesting mackerel. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{302-320}},
Abstract = {{The increased integration of ecosystem service concepts into natural
   resource management places renewed emphasis on prediction and mapping of
   fish biomass as a major provisioning service of rivers. The goals of
   this study were to predict and map patterns of fish biomass as a proxy
   for the availability of catchable fish for anglers in rivers and to
   identify the strongest landscape constraints on fish productivity. We
   examined hypotheses about fish responses to total phosphorus (TP), as TP
   is a growth-limiting nutrient known to cause increases (subsidy
   response) and/or decreases (stress response) in fish biomass depending
   on its concentration and the species being considered. Boosted
   regression trees were used to define nonlinear functions that predicted
   the standing crops of Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis, Brown Trout
   Salmo trutta, Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu, panfishes (seven
   centrarchid species), and Walleye Sander vitreus by using landscape and
   modeled local-scale predictors. Fitted models were highly significant
   and explained 22-56\% of the variation in validation data sets.
   Nonlinear and threshold responses were apparent for numerous predictors,
   including TP concentration, which had significant effects on all except
   the Walleye fishery. Brook Trout and Smallmouth Bass exhibited both
   subsidy and stress responses, panfish biomass exhibited a subsidy
   response only, and Brown Trout exhibited a stress response. Maps of
   reach-specific standing crop predictions showed patterns of predicted
   fish biomass that corresponded to spatial patterns in catchment area,
   water temperature, land cover, and nutrient availability. Maps
   illustrated predictions of higher trout biomass in coldwater streams
   draining glacial till in northern Michigan, higher Smallmouth Bass and
   panfish biomasses in warmwater systems of southern Michigan, and high
   Walleye biomass in large main-stem rivers throughout the state. Our
   results allow fisheries managers to examine the biomass potential of
   streams, describe geographic patterns of fisheries, explore possible
   nutrient management targets, and identify habitats that are candidates
   for species management.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research proposes that human beings are motivated to protect
   endangered species for various reasons: consumptive use value,
   non-consumptive use value, non-use value, and intrinsic value. However,
   it has been difficult to tease apart these values at the behavioral
   level. Using an innovative fishing game, we study an important tradeoff
   between one kind of use value (monetary value) and one kind of non-use
   value (existence value) of the endangered Steller sea lion. In the
   fishing game, players make repeated decisions on how much pollock to
   harvest for profit in each period in a dynamic ecosystem. The population
   of the endangered sea lion depends on the population of pollock, which
   in turn depends on the harvesting behavior of humans. The data show that
   in general, people responded to the financial value (as a tourist
   resource), but not the existence value, of the sea lion by cutting down
   commercial fish harvesting to keep more sea lions in the ecosystem.
   However, not all people behaved the same regarding the existence value.
   Females displayed a higher existence value than males, as did people who
   reported stronger pro-environmental attitudes than those with weaker
   pro-environmental attitudes. Our findings have multiple implications on

Abstract = {{We examine the Fisher market model when buyers, as well as sellers, have
   an intrinsic value for money. We show that when the buyers have
   oligopsonistic power they are highly incentivized to act strategically
   with their monetary reports, as their potential gains are unbounded.
   This is in contrast to the bounded gains that have been shown when
   agents strategically report utilities {[}5]. Our main focus is upon the
   consequences for social welfare when the buyers act strategically. To
   this end, we define the Price of Imperfect Competition (PoIC) as the
   worst case ratio of the welfare at a Nash equilibrium in the induced
   game compared to the welfare at a Walrasian equilibrium. We prove that
   the PoIC is at least 1 2 in markets with CES utilities with parameter 0
   <= rho <= 1 - this includes the classes of Cobb-Douglas and linear
   utility functions. Furthermore, for linear utility functions, we prove
   that the PoIC increases as the level of competition in the market
   increases. Additionally, we prove that a Nash equilibrium exists in the
   case of Cobb-Douglas utilities. In contrast, we show that Nash
   equilibria need not exist for linear utilities. However, in that case,
   good welfare guarantees are still obtained for the best response
   dynamics of the game.}},

   profits. Therefore, to overcome this problem, a method of price controls
   using Game Theory is considered. The Game Theory realizing a form of
   observational on the action and effects that occur by an individual or
   group to maximize the utilization under certain circumstances. The study
   was conducted on prices of 14 fish commodities in the state of
   Terengganu and also to see the cooperation effect between players of
   commodity prices. Data were analysed by using the software Gambit. The
   result shows that there is significant increase due to the influence of
   middlemen. The findings also shows that the price controls are applied
   at a set time, then it was applied to other times, prices are more
   stable and profitable returns to all parties can be maximized.}},

Abstract = {{The Fisher market model is one of the most fundamental resource
   allocation models in economics. In a Fisher market, the prices and
   allocations of goods are determined according to the preferences and
   budgets of buyers to clear the market.
   In a Fisher market game, however, buyers are strategic and report their
   preferences over goods; the market-clearing prices and allocations are
   then determined based on their reported preferences rather than their
   real preferences. We show that the Fisher market game always has a pure
   Nash equilibrium, for buyers with linear, Leontief, and Cobb-Douglas
   utility functions, which are three representative classes of utility
   functions in the important Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES)
   family. Furthermore, to quantify the social efficiency, we prove Price
   of Anarchy bounds for the game when the utility functions of buyers fall
   into these three classes respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Marine biological resources are likely to come under increasing stress
   over the course of the 21st century as global climate change and ocean
   acidification interact with other stresses, including heavy fishing
   pressures and marine pollution, to create far reaching and
   difficult-to-predict changes in species abundance, spatial distribution,
   and trophic interactions. The governance systems in place for marine
   fisheries and for the marine environment, more broadly, will be critical
   in determining the extent to which these resources can be managed for
   sustainability. The paper focuses on the governance of internationally
   shared fisheries, and draws on a body of game-theoretic research to
   discuss present-day governance problems and to evaluate the implications
   of global environmental change for future efforts to maintain
   cooperative and effective governance of shared fishery resources. In
   particular, the increased likelihood of abrupt and unpredictable changes
   in the productive potential and migratory behavior of exploited fish
   stocks may threaten to disrupt cooperative management arrangements. The
   paper discusses the value of contingency planning based on anticipation
   of the possibility of such events and concludes with a discussion of
   future directions for both research and policy development. Les

Abstract = {{Rapid growth of popular and lucrative catch-and-release marine
   sportfisheries worldwide has highlighted the need for reliable weight
   estimation methods for use in fishing tournaments, pursuit of fishing
   records, and to support scientific research that allows captured fish to
   be released alive. This paper describes new methods to predict weight
   from measurements of body size of game fish. Here we also evaluated
   efficacy of a widely used historical model and compared this to several
   new statistical and analytical weight estimation models that we
   developed herein. We applied these candidate models to a unique
   morphometric data set on Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) which
   contained information on body weight Was a function of fork length L and
   dorsal girth G for more than 1100 individuals from Florida, the Gulf of
   Mexico, Caribbean Sea and western Africa. A popular formula
   (W=G(2)L/800), developed more than a century ago specifically for tarpon
   was originally derived from geometric and physical relationships between
   fish body weight and shape. We found this model to be negatively biased
   >-15\% (i.e., underestimates individual fish weights) across the
   tarpon's entire size range up to 130 kg (the current world record). Bias
   for our ``new{''} ellipsoid volumetric formulation, which extends the
   principles of allometry, was less than 1\% across the entire range of
   observed sizes. Our new estimator was used by Texas Parks and Wildlife
   Department to assist fishery management in setting ``minimum maximum{''}
   sizes for recreationally caught tarpon that have the potential to break
   the Texas State record. It has also supported catch-and-release tarpon
   fisheries and tournaments in Florida, Texas, Mexico, and Trinidad. It
   provides a reliable means to accurately estimate weights of tarpon of
   potential (world) record sizes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Often, the way subject matter is included in educational games does not

   educational game is a game where the educational content is integrated
   in the game play mechanics themselves, rather than bolted-on using
   explicit messages. This research examines the relation between explicit
   messages, explorative game behavior, and comprehension by developing two
   versions of an endogenous educational game about overfishing, one with
   and one without an explicit purpose. The game was tested with 13
   children aged 8 to 11. The results indicate that factual knowledge and
   comprehension is increased with explicit messages, and in particular
   deep comprehension is fostered by explorative game behavior. This
   confirms the plea for endogenous games to teach about bombs, fish, coral

Abstract = {{Competitive interactions among reservoir fishes may be pronounced
   because fish assemblages in these artificial environments have had
   little time to develop niche-partitioning strategies that alleviate
   negative interspecific interactions. Such interactions may at times have
   been intensified by introductions of predators such as striped bass
   Morone saxatilis, introduced to create additional fisheries and control
   pelagic clupeids. Possible interactions between existing fish
   assemblages and striped bass include predation and competition. While
   there is a perception among angler groups that predation by striped bass
   on coexisting game fish is significant, most studies have reported
   little or no predation on game fish by striped bass and have considered
   predation rare and inconsequential. Moreover, predation that occurs will
   likely be compensatory and fail to reduce overall game fish survival.
   Any indirect effect of striped bass predation by restricting prey-sized
   game fish to limited refuge sites remains unknown. Exploitative
   competition may be more common. Although infrequently, introduced
   striped bass have depleted prey resources shared with other piscivores,
   particularly when stocking rates have been high, when there is a high
   rate of natural reproduction, or when prey supply has plunged in
   response to environmental fluxes. Fluctuation in prey supply, associated
   with ordinary environmental variability, and associated time lags in
   prey supply and predator demand, preclude adjusting predator densities
   to exactly balance demand with supply. The frequency of low supply
   demand ratios varies across systems and exhibits seasonal trends.
   Nevertheless, chronic supply demand imbalances are manageable where the
   predator assemblage is at least partially controlled through stocking,
   harvest regulations, or both. Because of the poor state of knowledge
   concerning the parameters defining balance and because uncontrollable
   annual fluctuations preclude exact management of alternating prey
   levels, we suggest adjusting stocking to manage demand so that it equals
   the median historical prey supply. Simulating the removal of striped
   bass and predicting the aftermath may be the most cost-effective way to
   provide decision support for stakeholders involved in determining if a
   striped bass stocking program is beneficial to most users.}},

Abstract = {{An abstract model of a pursuit-evasion game using tools from network
   economics is presented. Animal moves are represented as human
   migrations: people move to destinations that they find agreeable to
   migrate to and the associated decision-making depends on the specific
   characteristics of the location that they come from, the place that they
   migrate to, the distance between both, but also on the density and the
   characteristics of the other members of the human population living
   there. This competitive behavior results in a simple non-cooperative
   game. The repetition of this game, in turn, yields a dynamical system,
   the equilibrium of which may be computed using variational inequality
   tools. These ideas are implemented in the model of a vertical marine
   ecosystem in which big fish pursue small fish that try to evade, with
   the small fish preferring to live in surface and with the big fish
   preferring to reside in depth. The theoretical and computational results
   suggest that the specific trade-offs for both pursuers and evaders are
   important for the stability and the permanence of ecosystems. Then, we
   discuss how this quite simple model could be a first step toward a game
   theoretical formalization of the connectivity of marine ecosystems,
   which is an important and open question in marine ecology. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Habitat enhancement efforts meant to improve conditions for fish in
   degraded rivers have the potential to impact all resident fishes not
   just the focal population. Yet post-project ecological monitoring is
   often inadequately conducted, and in cases where restoration targets a
   single species, the impact on non-target fishes may be neglected. We
   investigated the diet and population attributes of two non-focal,
   resident fish species, the Sacramento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis)
   and prickly sculpin (Cottus asper), upstream of and within engineered
   habitat (hereafter the reference and restored reaches, respectively)
   intended to improve Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawning
   success. Population density, body size, stomach fullness, and prey
   importance were compared between populations residing in the reference
   and restored reaches. We also determined if the primary carbon source
   that supported common pikeminnow and sculpin prey differed between
   reaches using stable isotope analysis. Pikeminnow residing in the
   restored reach were significantly larger but less densely populated,
   exhibited greater condition factor values, and consumed more
   large-bodied prey. In contrast, sculpin in the restored reach were
   significantly smaller and more densely populated relative to the
   reference reach. Analysis of isotopic signatures suggests that
   macroinvertebrates supporting fish populations as prey principally
   depend on diatomaceous algae in the restored habitat, while filamentous
   algae were most important in the reference reach. Results suggest that
   restored salmonid habitat may represent significantly different

Abstract = {{Scope Fish liver, fish liver oil, oily fish and seagull eggs have been
   major sources of vitamin D for the coastal population of Norway. They
   also provide dioxin and polychlorinated dioxin-like compounds
   (dl-compounds), which may interfere with vitamin D homeostasis. We
   investigated whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) might be
   compromised by concomitant intake of dl-compounds. Methods and results:
   We studied 182 adults participating in the Norwegian Fish and Game
   Study. Participantswho consumed fish liver and/ or seagull eggs had
   higher dl-compound intake and blood concentrations than non-consumers (p
   < 0.001). Vitamin D intake was higher (p < 0.001), whereas serum 25(OH)

   non-consumers, vitamin D intake was associated with serum 25(OH) D (beta
   = 1.06; 95\% CI: 0.48, 1.63). This association was weaker among
   consumers (beta = 0.52; 95\% CI: -0.05, 1.08), but strengthened when
   adjusted for retinol intake (beta = 0.66; 95\% CI: 0.12, 1.21). The
   association between vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH) D did not seem to
   be compromised by intake of dl-compounds. Conclusion: To secure adequate
   vitamin D status while keeping the intake of dioxins and
   dlpolychlorinated biphenyls low, a healthy diet should include both
   supplemental vitamin D and oily fish. Despite high nutrient content,
   dietary fish liver and seagull eggs should be restricted, due to
   dl-compounds and possible vitamin A-D antagonism.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that climate change will be one of the
   primary challenges facing future development and agriculture. Farmers,
   whether crop or livestock farmers, will be faced with tradeoffs and

   commercial livestock and game farmers' knowledge and perceptions of
   climate variability and change in the semiarid Great Fish River Valley,
   South Africa, and their coping responses to a severe regional drought in
   2009/2010. Detailed questionnaires revealed that farmers' knowledge of
   global climate change was incomplete, suggesting that measures are
   needed to increase their understanding and awareness of likely impacts.
   Farmers were able to articulate a consistent story regarding how they
   believed local climate to have changed and most had implemented a
   variety of coping strategies in order to endure the drought. Some of
   these strategies were seen to have the potential to become longer-term
   adaptive practices. Farmers were, on the whole, open to considering new
   approaches and land uses such as carbon farming with Portulacaria afra
   (spekboom) to help them adapt to a more uncertain future.}},

Abstract = {{We report the results of an unprecedented real Minority Game (MG) played
   by university staff members who clicked one of two identical buttons (A

   recorded the number of people who clicked button A for 1288 games,
   beginning on April 21, 2008 and ending on October 31, 2010, and
   calculated the variance among the people who clicked A as a function of
   time. The evolution of the variance shows that the global gain of
   selfish agents increases when a small portion of agents make persistent
   choice in the games. We also carried out another experiment in which we
   forced 101 fish to enter one of the two symmetric chambers (A and B). We
   repeated the fish experiment 500 times and found that the variance of
   the number of fish that entered chamber A evolved in a way similar to
   the human MG, suggesting that fish have memory and can employ more
   strategies when facing the same situation again and again. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Evolutionary game dynamics in finite size populations can be described

   method that used in a noiseless case, the introducing of the noise
   intensity parameter makes the process an ergodic Markov process and
   based on the limit distribution of the process, we can analysis the
   evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) of the games. We illustrate the
   effects of the two parameters on the ESS of games using the Prisoner's
   dilemma games (PDG) and the snowdrift games (SG). We also compare the
   ESS of our model with that of the replicator dynamics in infinite size
   populations. The results are determined by simulation experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We compared biological and ecological traits between global game fish
   and non-game fish species using an analysis with randomly chosen fish
   species from each group and an analysis where species were matched by
   body length. We used data from the International Game Fish Association
   (IGFA), FishBase, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature
   (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Game fish species were defined as
   being present in the IGFA world record list. The random comparison
   revealed that on average game fish were significantly larger (155.0 +/-
   121.5 versus 34.1 +/- 59.5 cm), occupied shallower minimum depths (19.4
   +/- 58.8 versus 130.0 +/- 359.0 m), had a broader latitudinal range (51
   degrees.2 +/- 29.4 degrees versus 31.1 degrees +/- 25.9 degrees), and
   significantly higher trophic levels (4.1 +/- 0.1 versus 3.4 +/- 0.1
   trophic units) than non-game fish species. The length-matched analysis
   similarly identified that game fish species occupied higher trophic
   levels than non-game fish(3.9 +/- 0.4 versus 3.6 +/- 0.6 trophic units),
   but latitudinal range and depth associations did not differ between
   groups. Both the random and length-matched analyses revealed that game
   fish were more commonly found in freshwater than non-game fish. Both
   analyses found that game fish species were more migratory and that both
   groups differed in their geographical distributions. The random
   comparison revealed that game fish were significantly more targeted by
   commercial fisheries, less resilient, and more threatened relative to
   non-game fish. Caution must be exercised when synthesizing data from
   broad data sources, yet this study identifies important differences
   between game fish and non-game fish species, which are relevant to
   management and conservation initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteriocins produced by enterococci, referred to as enterocins, possess

   this context, the aim of the present study was to determine the
   antimicrobial activity and the presence of bacteriocin structural genes
   in fecal enterococcal isolates from animal origins. Evaluation of the
   direct antimicrobial activity of 253 isolates from wild boars (Sus
   scrofa, n = 69), mullets (Liza ramada, n = 117), and partridges (Perdix
   perdix, n = 67) against eight indicator bacterial strains (including
   Listeria monocytogenes, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Enterococcus spp.)
   showed that 177 (70\%) exerted antimicrobial activity against at least
   one indicator microorganism. From these isolates, 123 were further
   selected on the basis of their inhibition group, and 81 were found to be
   producers of bacteriocins active against Listeria monocytogenes.
   Analysis of the presence of enterocin structural genes in a subset of 36
   isolates showed that 70\% harbored one or more of the evaluated genes,
   those of enterocin P and hiracin JM79 being the most prevalent. These
   results show that wild animals constitute an appropriate source for the

Abstract = {{While military protocol requires that POWs provide only name, rank,
   serial number, and date of birth (the so-called Big 4), it is naive to
   think that all detainees, including terrorists, behave in this fashion.
   Instead, there is evidence that detainees partially cooperate with their
   captors by revealing a limited amount of valuable information during the
   interrogation process. Such a strategy makes it appear that the detainee
   is cooperative and, since interrogations can be costly, serves as a
   disincentive for further interrogation. In order to capture the
   essential differences between the two strategies, we model two different
   types of games between the interrogator and the detainee. Specifically,
   we compare the Big 4 game to a two-stage game (the Little Fish game) in
   which the detainee is permitted to reveal low-level information to the
   interrogator. We formalize both games, derive the optimal rules for each
   player, and show that the Big 4 game may not be optimal for either
   player or for the overall well-being of the interrogating nation. As
   such, the Little Fish game can Pareto-dominate the Big 4 game. Hence, it
   is possible that the al-Qaeda strategy of partial cooperation is
   superior to that used by most standing armies. We also show that the
   level of intensity selected by the interrogator must be balanced by such
   factors as the moral values of the society and recruiting potential of
   the terrorists versus the likelihood of obtaining important information.}},

Abstract = {{In situations of declining or depleted fish stocks, exploiters seem to
   have fallen prey to the Tragedy of the Commons, which occurs when the
   maximisation of short-term self-interest produces outcomes leaving all
   participants worse off than feasible alternatives would. Standard
   economic theory predicts that in social dilemmas, such as fishing from a
   common resource, individuals are not willing to cooperate and sacrifice
   catches in the short term, and that, consequently, the resource is
   overharvested. However, over the last decades, a multitude of research
   has shown that humans often achieve outcomes that are `better than
   rational' by building conditions where reciprocity, reputation, and
   trust help to overcome the temptations of short-term self-interest. The
   evolution of the natural human tendency to cooperate under certain
   conditions can be explained, and its neuro-physiological and genetic
   bases are being unravelled. Nevertheless, fisheries management still
   often deploys top-down regulation and economic incentives in its aim to
   regulate fisher behaviour, and under-utilizes the potential for
   spontaneous responsible fisher behaviour through setting conditions that
   enhance natural cooperative tendencies. Here I introduce this body of
   knowledge on how to overcome the Tragedy of the Commons to the audience
   of fisheries scientists, hoping to open up novel ways of thinking in
   this field. I do this through a series of thought experiments, based on
   actual published experiments, exploring under what conditions
   responsible and cooperative fisher behaviour can be expected. Keys
   include reputation-building and indirect reciprocity, face-to-face
   communication, knowledge on the state of the resource, and self-decision
   on rules and sanctions.}},

Abstract = {{Like the terrestrial robots playing football, fishlike robots can play
   polo game in the water. The accurate trajectory control of autonomous
   robot fish based on local vision information plays an important role in
   the game. However, path planning approaches for fishlike robots were
   lacking in the literature. Here, we develop a tangent circle method,
   which is based on its inherent kinematic constraints, to plan an
   executable path for the robot fish. Two kinds of tangent circles are
   defined to represent the motion tendencies of robot fish, and are drawn
   accurately by control parameters. By means of the combination of tangent
   circles and their external or internal common tangent, the robot fish

Abstract = {{The literature on game theory and fisheries is reviewed, beginning with
   the initial papers from the late 1970s on cooperative and noncooperative
   games. Later developments considered repeated games and trigger
   strategies as well as the stability of coalitions. It is argued that the
   latter literature is overly pessimistic in that it does not pursue
   breakdown of successive coalitions to its ultimate end, which may
   provide a worse outcome than an apparently unstable coalition. The
   choice of strategic variable is considered at some length, but in the
   existing literature this choice is seldom explicitly motivated.
   Similarly the spatial distribution of fish is seldom analyzed in the
   existing literature, but it could make a difference. This article looks
   at fishing in a common pool, fishing in separate pools with interacting
   substocks, and sequential fishing. Fishing on the high seas is discussed
   and the enforcement issue identified as an underresearched Problem.
   Imperfect information on fish stocks and their migrations is also
   under-researched.}},

Abstract = {{The environmental assessment of long-term nuclear waste management
   requires data to estimate food chain transfers for radionuclides in
   various environmental settings. For key elements such as iodine (I) and
   chlorine (Cl), there is a paucity of transfer factor data, particularly
   outside of agricultural food chains. This study dealt with transfers of
   I, Cl and 28 other elements to foods that would be typical of boreal
   hunter/gatherer lifestyles, as well as being common foods for modern
   recreational and subsistence hunters. Food/substrate concentration
   ratios (CRs) and related transfer factors for eight species of widely
   distributed fish, whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Canada geese
   (Branta canadensis) and wild blueberries (Vaccinium myrtilloides) were
   measured and compared to the literature. Limited data were obtained for
   caribou (Rangifer tarandus), elk (Cervus elaphus) and moose (Alces
   americanus). Freshwater sediment Kd values and CRs for a ubiquitous
   freshwater macrophyte were also obtained. The CRs for I in fish were 29
   L kg(-1) in edible muscle (fillets) of large-bodied species and 85 L
   kg(-1) for whole, small-bodied fish. The log CRs for fish and
   macrophytes were correlated across elements. For several elements, the
   Kds for sediments in deep water were similar to 4-fold higher than for
   littoral samples. The elemental transfers to wild animals for some
   elements were notably different than the literature indicates for
   domestic animals. It is argued that the transfer data obtained using
   indigenous elements from real environmental settings, as opposed to
   contaminant elements in experimental or impacted environments, are
   especially relevant to assessment of long-term impacts. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Just as humans succumb to hypothermia, fishes can die if their core body
   temperature falls below their lower lethal limit. Record-setting cold
   weather in the southern United States between January 8 and 12, 2010,
   put numerous recreational game fish species at risk, particularly those
   living in the shallow, rapidly cooled waters of the Laguna Madre, Texas.
   Cognizant of the danger of barge traffic in the Land Cut, a section of
   the Intracoastal Waterway in the Laguna Madre, poses to cold-stressed
   fishes, Gulf Intracoastal Canal Association (GICA) members voluntarily
   sacrificed \$7,000 per tow to protect the resource. Described here is
   the collaboration among academics at Texas A\&M University-Corpus
   Christi, Texas A\&M University, industry leaders from the Gulf
   Intracoastal Canal Association, and conservationists from the Coastal
   Conservation Association Texas, which led to the pooling of financial
   and human resources to mitigate game fish mortalities during a recent
   extreme cold weather event, or norther, as Texans refer to it. A new
   water temperature forecasting tool, in development and tested in this
   partnership, is discussed in terms of ecosystem-based management, of
   which a key component is engaging multiple stakeholders in a
   collaborative process to define problems and find solutions. The

Abstract = {{The conditions under which humans benefit from contributing to a public
   good have attracted great interest; in particular the potential role of
   punishment of cheaters is hotly debated. In contrast, similar studies on
   other animals are lacking. In this study, we describe for the first time
   how the course of interactions between parasitic sabre-tooth blennies
   (the cheaters) and their reef fish victims can be used to study both
   punishment and the emergence of public goods. Sabre tooth blennies
   (Plagiotremus sp.) sneak up from behind to bite off small pieces of
   scales and/or mucus from other fish. Victims regularly show spontaneous
   aggression as well as aggressive responses to blenny attacks. In a
   between species comparison, we tested how the probability of chasing a
   blenny is affected by (1) the option of avoiding interactions with a
   blenny by avoiding its small territory, and (2) variation in local
   abundance of conspecifics. We found that resident victim species are
   more aggressive towards blennies than visiting species. This difference
   persisted when we controlled for victim size and territoriality,
   suggesting that it is the enforced repeated game structure that causes
   residents to chase blennies. In residents, we also found a negative
   correlation between aggression towards blennies and local abundance,
   which suggests that the benefits of chasing are diluted with increasing
   local abundance. We discuss the implication of these results for future
   studies.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{139}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Future alterations in land cover and climate are likely to cause
   substantial changes in the ranges of fish species. Predictive
   distribution models are an important tool for assessing the probability
   that these changes will cause increases or decreases in or the
   extirpation of species. Classification tree models that predict the
   probability of game fish presence were applied to the streams of the
   Muskegon River watershed, Michigan. The models were used to study three
   potential future scenarios: (1) land cover change only, (2) land cover
   change and a 3 degrees C increase in air temperature by 2100, and (3)
   land cover change and a 5 degrees C increase in air temperature by 2100.
   The analysis indicated that the expected change in air temperature and
   subsequent change in water temperatures would result in the decline of
   coldwater fish in the Muskegon watershed by the end of the 21st century
   while cool-and warmwater species would significantly increase their
   ranges. The greatest decline detected was a 90\% reduction in the
   probability that brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis would occur in
   Bigelow Creek. The greatest increase was a 276\% increase in the
   probability that northern pike Esox lucius would occur in the Middle
   Branch River. Changes in land cover are expected to cause large changes
   in a few fish species, such as walleye Sander vitreus and Chinook salmon
   Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, but not to drive major changes in species
   composition. Managers can alter stream environmental conditions to
   maximize the probability that species will reside in particular stream
   reaches through application of the classification tree models. Such
   models represent a good way to predict future changes, as they give
   quantitative estimates of the n-dimensional niches for particular
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty years have passed since Munro published his 1979 work on the
   potential applications of game theory to fisheries. It is pertinent to
   ask now: has this potential been realized, and in what forms? This paper
   highlights progress in the field over the past three decades. We begin
   our review with the early two-player dynamic game-theoretic analyses.
   Next, we illustrate how coalition theory has been brought in over the
   past decade to allow the modeling of games with greater than two
   players, and how coalitional externalities, a major issue in
   international and shared fish stocks management, have been incorporated
   recently. Finally, we highlight new areas for game theory to come into
   its own in fisheries, which will most definitely include the potential
   for catch rights in international shared-stock fisheries, as well as
   ecosystem dynamics to be modeled in a game-theoretic context. As game
   theory can offer insights into the challenges of achieving cooperative
   fisheries management, we hope the next decade of fisheries economics
   research will include a bigger leap from academic game theory exercises

   The purpose of our review was to assess the evidence for
   population-level impacts on salmonid populations, and/or economic
   impacts on Scottish game fisheries of predation by the four primary UK
   freshwater piscivorous bird species: cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo,
   goosander Mergus merganser, red-breasted merganser Mergus serrator and
   grey heron Ardea cinerea. There is evidence that these birds can, in
   some situations, remove large numbers of fish from stocked and natural
   fisheries. However, a lack of information on fish population levels, the
   numbers and species composition of feeding birds, and robust
   calculations of fish consumption has hampered the conversion of the
   results of the existing studies into useful quantitative measures of
   impact. As a consequence, few studies have demonstrated any reductions
   in numbers of breeding fish or fish productivity due to predation by
   piscivorous birds, or direct economic loss to fisheries in Scotland. We
   support a previous recommendation for a reiterative procedure of
   modelling, experimentation and remodelling to assess the impacts of
   piscivorous birds on fisheries. Wide-scale Studies of the movements of
   piscivorous birds, their feeding locations in relation to river
   characteristics, and the factors that make fish particularly vulnerable
   to predation are seen as important areas for future research.}},

   Ictalurus punctatus and 65,000 rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were
   stocked in spring/summer and winter, respectively, in 22 cities. Channel
   catfish and rainbow trout were both stocked at approximately 200 fish
   per acre per month. Hybrid striped bass Morone saxatilis x M. chrysops
   were stocked at 50-100 fish per acre when fish became available. Trophy
   blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus from 15 to 60 lb were stocked on
   occasion to increase media attention and generate angler excitement at
   Program locations. Anglers were permitted to harvest three channel
   catfish, three hybrid striped bass, and five rainbow trout per day with
   no length restrictions. Largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides were catch
   and release only and the sunfish Lepomis spp. daily limit was 25. Ten
   fishing derbies and 14 fishing clinics were provided free to the public
   in 2007 to facilitate angler education and family participation. The

Abstract = {{Red shrimp, Aristeus antennatus (Risso, 18 16) is one of the most
   important resources for the bottom-trawl fleets in the northwestern
   Mediterranean, in terms of both landings and economic value. A simple
   bioeconomic model introducing Game Theory for the prediction of effort
   dynamics at vessel level is proposed. The game is performed by the
   twelve vessels exploiting red shrimp in Blanes. Within the game, two
   solutions are performed: non-cooperation and cooperation. The first is
   proposed as a realistic method for the prediction of individual effort
   strategies and the second is used to illustrate the potential
   profitability of the analysed fishery. The effort strategy for each
   vessel is the number of fishing days per year and their objective is
   profit maximisation, individual profits for the non-cooperative solution
   and total profits for the cooperative one. In the present analysis,
   strategic conflicts arise from the differences between vessels in
   technical efficiency (catchability coefficient) and economic efficiency
   (defined here). The ten-year and 1000-iteration stochastic simulations
   performed for the two effort solutions show that the best strategy from
   both an economic and a conservationist perspective is homogeneous effort
   cooperation. However, the results under non-cooperation are more similar
   to the observed data on effort strategies and landings.}},

Abstract = {{Success in fishing depends upon knowledge of the whereabouts of fish,

   traditional sociology and tools of rational choice theory can be
   established. It outlines practices of information management in
   Norwegian pelagic fisheries, arguing that a shared set of behavioural
   norms delimits the set of probable strategies, making a co-operative
   strategy emerge to the actors as the most beneficial choice. Social
   norms are integral parts of the actors' strategic reasoning and
   facilitate rational adaptation. The article combines traditional

Abstract = {{In this article I defend my previously published system approach to game
   playing in sports (Lebed, 2006). Founded on the main argument of mine
   about insufficiency of performance analysis only for games study, it is
   based on an inter-disciplinary comprehension of sporting game events
   from four different angles: the logical-philosophical, the behavioural
   (performance), the anthropological, and complexity angles. The paper
   consists of four parts, corresponding to the four angles. The first
   three parts offer deconstructive and reconstructive analysis. The three
   provide criticism of McGarry and Frank's arguments against my view of
   complex dynamical systems in sports. The logical analysis negates my
   opponents' general view of a match (a process) as a dynamical system.
   The behaviour analysis refutes their claim about couple oscillator
   dynamics as a universal dynamically interpreted model of game playing.
   The anthropological panoramic vision of sporting games leads me to
   conclude that my opponents' analysis of two exclusively interacting
   sides in a squash or soccer contest is too narrow and insufficient to
   explain the broad diversity of games. According to the classification
   suggested in Lebed (2004), 1 offer seven possible models that can
   systematically reflect different groups of games. In the fourth part,
   the complexity angle is analysed from a constructive point of view. Here
   I take one of the above seven models and try to outline a
   ``soccer-like{''} game perspective modelling founded on the view of play
   process as a conflict of two four-level self-regulating complex systems,
   where each one is additionally involved in its own loop of cybernetic
   regulation.}},

Abstract = {{The use of DNA in forensics has grown rapidly for human applications
   along with the concomitant development of bioinformatics and demographic
   databases to help fully realize the potential of this molecular
   information. Similar techniques are also used routinely in many wildlife
   cases, such as species identification in food products, poaching and the
   illegal trade of endangered species. The use of molecular techniques in
   forensic cases related to wildlife and the development of associated
   databases has, however, mainly focused on large mammals with the
   exception of a few high-profile species. There is a need to develop
   similar databases for aquatic species for fisheries enforcement, given
   the large number of exploited and endangered fish species, the intensity
   of exploitation, and challenges in identifying species and their derived
   products. We sequenced a 500 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome
   b gene from representative individuals from 26 harvested fish taxa from
   Ontario, Canada, focusing on species that support major commercial and
   recreational fisheries. Ontario provides a unique model system for the
   development of a fish species database, as the province contains an
   evolutionarily diverse array of freshwater fish families representing
   more than one third of all freshwater fish in Canada. Inter- and
   intraspecific sequence comparisons using phylogenetic analysis and a
   BLAST search algorithm provided rigorous statistical metrics for species
   identification. This methodology and these data will aid in fisheries
   enforcement, providing a tool to easily and accurately identify fish
   species in enforcement investigations that would have otherwise been
   difficult or impossible to pursue. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Evolutionary game dynamics in finite populations can be described by a

   proportional to their payoff. The next generation is sampled randomly
   from this pool of offspring. The total population size is constant. The
   resulting Markov process has two absorbing states corresponding to
   homogeneous populations of all A or all B. We quantify frequency
   dependent selection by comparing the absorption probabilities to the
   corresponding probabilities under random drift. We derive conditions for
   selection to favor one strategy or the other by using the concept of
   total positivity. In the limit of weak selection, we obtain the 1/3 law:
   if A and B are strict Nash equilibria then selection favors replacement
   of B by A, if the unstable equilibrium occurs at a frequency of A which
   is less than 1/3.}},

Abstract = {{A sedentary lifestyle is a contributing factor to chronic diseases, and
   it is often correlated with obesity. To promote an increase in physical
   activity, we created a social computer game, Fish'n'Steps, which links a
   player's daily foot step count to the growth and activity of an animated
   virtual character, a fish in a fish tank. As further encouragement, some
   of the players' fish tanks included other players' fish, thereby
   creating an environment of both cooperation and competition. In a
   fourteen-week study with nineteen participants, the game served as a
   catalyst for promoting exercise and for improving game players'
   attitudes towards physical activity. Furthermore, although most player's
   enthusiasm in the game decreased after the game's first two Weeks,
   analyzing the results using Prochaska's Transtheoretical Model of
   Behavioral Change suggests that individuals had, by that time,
   established new routines that led to healthier patterns of physical
   activity in their daily lives. Lessons learned from this study
   underscore the value of such games to encourage rather than provide
   negative reinforcement, especially when individuals are not meeting
   their own expectations, to foster long-term behavioral change.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of mixed strategies from game theory is combined with basic
   economic concepts and a biomass dynamics model to capture important
   aspects of a fishery cooperative system. The concept of discounting,
   which is assumed to be a function of the intrinsic growth rate of the
   fish stock, is applied to mimic the fishers' tendency to cooperate.
   Profits from fishing, discounted by the tendency to cooperate, are
   specified for each fisher under various circumstances and viewed as a
   two by two matrix game, with two players and two strategies (cooperative
   and non-cooperative). The payoffs in the matrix determine the
   equilibrium outcome for the game. The results indicate that the
   biological parameters, intrinsic growth rate and stock size, can have
   important influence on the fishers' cooperation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Catostomid fishes are a diverse family of 76+ freshwater species that
   are distributed across North America in many different habitats. This
   group of fish is facing a variety of impacts and conservation issues
   that are somewhat unique relative to more economically valuable and
   heavily managed fish species. Here, we present a brief series of case
   studies to highlight the threats such as migration barriers, flow
   regulation, environmental contamination, habitat degradation,
   exploitation and impacts from introduced (non-native) species that are
   facing catostomids in different regions. Collectively, the case studies
   reveal that individual species usually are not threatened by a single,
   isolated factor. Instead, species in general face numerous stressors
   that threaten multiple stages of their life history. Several factors
   have retarded sucker conservation including widespread inabilities of
   field workers to distinguish some species, lack of basic natural history
   and ecological knowledge of life history, and the misconception that
   suckers are tolerant of degraded conditions and are of little social or
   ecological value. Without a specific constituent group lobbying for
   conservation of non-game fishes, all such species, including members of
   the catostomid family, will continue to face serious risks because of
   neglect, ignorance, and misunderstanding. We suggest that conservation
   strategies should incorporate research and education/outreach
   components. Other conservation strategies that would be effective for
   protecting suckers include freshwater protected areas for critical
   habitat, restoration of degraded habitat, and design of
   catostomid-friendly fish bypass facilities. We believe that the plight
   of the catostomids is representative of the threats facing many other
   non-game freshwater fishes with diverse life-history strategies
   globally. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature tolerance quantified as CTminima and CTmaxima of channel
   catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus), largemouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides)

   days of exposure to a 10 degreesC diel thermoperiod were compared to
   those determined at constant acclimation temperatures equal to the
   minimum, midpoint and maximum of each species' thermoperiod. The diel
   thermoperiod for channel catfish and largemouth bass extended from 20 to
   30 degreesC while rainbow trout were cycled between 10 and 20 degreesC.
   A hypothesis that the zone of temperature tolerance would be enlarged
   during exposure to a 10 degreesC thermoperiod was tested. Mean CTmaxima
   and CTminima during cycling ranged from 38.5 to 39.6 degreesC and 6.1 to
   6.6 degreesC ( channel catfish), 35.6 to 37.3 degreesC and 5.9 to 7.7
   degreesC ( largemouth bass) and 27.3 to 29.3 degreesC and 0.1 to 1.4
   degreesC ( rainbow trout). Our data indicate that with one exception
   both upper and lower temperature tolerance for each of these three
   species exposed to the diel temperature cycle were more similar to those
   of fish acclimated to a constant temperature near the midpoint of the
   thermoperiod than to either the minimum or maximum temperature of the
   cycle. The exception occurred in rainbow trout where the mean CTmaximum
   during cycling was equivalent to an acclimation temperature midway
   between the mean and peak acclimation temperature. Furthermore, in all
   three species the temperature tolerance scope ( CTmaximum) CTminimum)
   was less in fish exposed to the thermoperiod used in this research. The
   temperature tolerance ability of any of the three test species was not

   Clients visit cleaners at their small territories, so-called cleaning
   stations, to have parasites removed. Cleaners were first observed and
   then caught and either put back on their original territory or moved to
   a new site. I noted a variety of cleaner and client behaviour to
   evaluate how, if at all, relationships are built up. Cleaners and
   resident clients indeed build up relationships, but with heavy initial
   investment. There was no evidence that cleaners build up relationships
   with client species that have access to several cleaners. Finally, it
   appeared that cleaners constantly invest in relationships with predatory
   clients, possibly to reduce the risk that predators try to catch them. I
   propose that asymmetries between partners with respect to either payoff
   values or strategic options are the major reason why the results do not
   fit the so-called raising-the-stakes strategy.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of size-specific mercury (Hg) concentrations in game fish from
   a subset of Maryland fresh and estuarine waters was conducted, in which
   Hg concentrations in 112 fish from seven freshwater impoundments and
   three tidal and four estuarine locations in Chesapeake Bay and its
   tributaries were measured. Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) was the most
   intensively examined species. Of the fish examined, the largest
   freshwater sportfish contained the highest Hg concentrations. Striped
   bass and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) from Chesapeake Bay and
   its tributaries contained less Hg at the same size than the same species
   in fresh waters. Large striped bass, chain pickerel (Esox niger), and
   walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) from Deep Creek Lake and Liberty
   Reservoir exceeded the FDA action level of 1 mg Hg/kg. Striped bass,
   largemouth bass, and white crappie (Pomoxis annularis) in other
   impoundments equaled or exceeded a common advisory level of 0.5 mg
   Hg/kg. Large differences in size-normalized Hg concentrations among
   lakes and particularly between fresh and salt waters highlight the large
   differences in MeHg production and bioaccumulation among ecosystems.
   This work indicates that a more comprehensive study of Hg in Maryland
   fish is warranted to protect human and wildlife health.}},

Abstract = {{Game theory is a formal tool for analysing strategic interaction between
   a finite number of agents. The fact that usually more than one entity or

   in the use of game theory and applications thereof to analyse fishery
   management problems. This review shows that game-theoretic modelling has
   made significant contributions to our understanding of the problems of
   fishery resource management. However, many challenges still remain. For
   instance, models of straddling stocks are yet to be fully developed. In
   addition, fisheries economists have not yet fully exploited the
   opportunity provided by computational methods now available, and the
   ever increasing power of computers, to develop more empirical
   game-theoretic models for practical fisheries management. (C) 1998

   the bulk of the data used in the analyses. The results show that
   Cormorants ave widespread at inland stillwater game fisheries in England
   and Wales throughout the year, with higher densities present during
   October-March. Peak counts by fishery managers at 45 of the fisheries
   increased by about 20\% per year, regardless of season. Site use by
   Cormorants is investigated and the results imply that large, low
   altitude sites that are close to rivers in southern England are more
   likely to be used by these birds. The survey revealed that Cormorants
   are widely perceived by fishery managers to be responsible for
   significant economic losses through consumption and/or injury of stock
   fish. While this may be justified locally we found no overall
   relationship between Cormorant density and anglers' catches of Rainbow

   standard deviations generally less than 0.5 degrees C. Channel catfish
   had the largest thermal tolerance scope of the three species while
   rainbow trout had the lowest tolerance of high temperatures and the
   highest tolerance of low temperatures. In all species CT minima and CT
   maxima were highly significantly linearly related to acclimation
   temperature. Within each species, slopes relating CT maxima to
   acclimation temperature were approximately half as large as those

Abstract = {{Many states share bordering waters often separated by an invisible state

   opposite bank. Lack of law enforcement created a dangerous environment

   was the case on the bordering waters of southeast Texas and southwest
   Louisiana prior to May 1996, when Operation Border-safe was instituted.

   territories along the Kazinga Channel (5.1 km(2) in comparison with 0.9

Abstract = {{The Lagrangians of physics arise out of a mathematical game between a
   `'smart'' measurer and nature (personified by a demon). Each contestant
   wants to maximize his level of Fisher information I. The game is zero
   sum, by conservation of information in the closed system. The payoff of
   the game introduces a variational principle - extreme physical
   information (EPI)- which fixes both the Lagrangian and the physical
   constant of each scenario. The EPI approach provides an understanding of
   the relationship between measurement and physical law. EPI also defines
   a prescription for constructing Lagrangians. The prior knowledge
   required for this purpose is a rule of symmetry or conservation that
   implies a unitary transformation for which I remains invariant. As an
   example, when applied to the smart measurement of the space-time
   coordinate of a particle, the symmetry used is that between
   position-time space and momentum-energy space. Then the unitary
   transformation is the Fourier one, and EPI derives the following: the
   equivalence of energy, momentum, and mass; the constancy of Planck's
   parameter h; and the Lagrangian that implies both the Klein-Gordon
   equation and the Dirac equation of quantum mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Illegal gill and seine netting has taken place in the northern parts of
   the Lake St Lucia Game Reserve, South Africa since the late 1960s.
   Although active law enforcement by the Natal Parks Board was able to
   prevent the large-scale commercialization of this activity, illegal
   netting has continued to take place. The present policy to prohibit
   netting in the lake has resulted in conflict between the rural
   communities and the conservation authorities. An attempt was made to
   quantify the catch taken by illegal netting by analysing data collected
   during antinetting patrols and by negotiating with rural communities
   living in areas adjacent to the lake. Results showed that approximately
   72 people were actively fishing with nets in Lake St Lucia during 1992,
   and their annual catch was estimated at between 91 and 135 tonnes.
   Competition with the recreational line fishery was limited as mugilids
   and other detritivorous fish species made up 47\% by mass of the total
   catch taken by netting. Legalisation of a controlled net fishery in St
   Lucia is discussed as, a management option to integrate rural
   development with conservation of the lake's fish resources.}},

Abstract = {{Given a choice between habitats differing only in food availability,
   prey are known to select the habitat providing the highest energetic
   return. They do so in a frequency-dependent manner, accounting for the
   reduction in food availability caused by the presence of other
   individuals; this results in the well-known `Ideal Free Distribution',
   an equilibrium solution to a spatial game. When habitats also differ in
   predation risk due, for example, to different predator densities, prey
   also appear able to take this into account. However, in most theory (and
   most experiments) the predation risk levels in the available habitats
   are assumed to be fixed. Here we ask what will happen if predators are
   able to adjust their distribution in response to the habitat choice
   decisions of their prey, i.e. we model a generalized habitat selection
   game between predators and prey. We first develop a basic model which
   captures the essence of the problem, and then expand it to include risk
   dilution and interference among predators. The model produces several
   new insights, notably that, in the absence of interference effects, the
   density of prey in a habitat is determined solely by the inherent
   `riskiness' of that habitat (a habitat measure independent of predator
   density, which might reflect cover or light levels, for example) and is
   unaffected by habitat productivity (a measure of the food resource
   available to the prey). When interference exists between predators, prey
   density is also determined by habitat productivity but to a lesser
   extent than by riskiness. Consequently, prey may not respond
   significantly to changes in relative food resource availability among
   habitats if their predators are also free to choose the habitat which
   maximizes their expected fitness. We consider briefly the potential
   applications of game theory to diel vertical migration and other fish
   predator-prey scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The legislative frame of animal welfare in fishing is built by the
   German Animal Protection Act. It is completed by different State
   legislations on fishing, which essential parts are based on a number of
   judicial decisions concerning this subject.
   To be aquainted with the legal directions is of course a necessity for
   game fishers. Nevertheless, the real attitude in conformity with the
   rules of animal protection is determined by a comprehensive knowledge of
   the species fish and its aquaeous biotope. In the Federal Republic of
   Germany, an official fishing license is aquired after as special
   examination, which gives certain guarantee of experience in this field.
   In practice, however, a lot of deficiencies are observed in handling
   this vertebrate, which is capable of passion.
   As a consequence, we claim for a game fisher who is familiar with our
   native fish fauna and its biotope, who is responsible with the fish
   creatures and aims at maintaining a healthy and speciesrich fish stock
   in our waters.}},

   fairs, schools, boat shows, town festivals, fishing seminars, clinics,
   etc. It is often stocked with 25 or 30 different species of fish, all
   indigenous to Arkansas waters. The Aquarium provides an excellent tool
   for teaching various fishing techniques, lure demonstrations, and fish
